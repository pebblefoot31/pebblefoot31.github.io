Title: My experience as a tech lead in hack 4 impact

In the past, tech leads have been given a generous amount of independence and autonomy 
when determining how to lead their teams in the development of a project. I believe it 
could be beneficial for former tech leads to 'train' their successor tech leads (even 
a guiding document could be helpful if it can't be in person!) about the fine details of
running meetings. For example, an agenda for sprints in addition to the provided suggestion
for the first meeting, could be valuable. This could enforce a certain standard of leadership
across teams and ensure that developers are provided quality mentorship as they work with
the team. One thing that came to mind after my first tech meeting was the importance of walking
the team through every step in the task description rather than just handing it to them to read.
Since initial tasks are simple enough, it might be alright, but in future meetings I strive
to go through the entire explanation of a task together in case anyone has any questions.

Meeting times: The hardest part about working as a team is meeting as one.
