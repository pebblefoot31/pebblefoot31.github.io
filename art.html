        <p>Art is central to my life. It gives me happiness and creative thinking skills that are useful in countless unrelated situations. Lately, finding the time and motivation to create art has been lacking for me, especially as I just completed my junior year of high school. With a website to display my art on, I hope to find greater motivation to make time for art in my life no matter how occupied I become. I specialize in henna art, calligraphic cards and signs, painting (oils and acrylics), sketches, fine color pencil art, and even jewelry making. I am also happy to paint just about anything- from rusted metal sculptures to wooden birdhouses to hang in your lawn.</p>
