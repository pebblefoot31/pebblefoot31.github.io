          Hi, I’m Nia! I am an undergraduate student studying computer science and data science 
          at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK). So far, I have had experiences with web 
          development and scientific computing (head over to my blog to learn more about my past 
          work). In my free time, I run a small henna art business where I can slow down, work 
          with my hands, and connect with people in an entirely different way. Although I am currently 
          living in the states with my family, I have previously lived on three different 
          continents and visited several countries– a list I look forward to expanding. I like 
          to unwind by spending time with loved ones, baking, exercising, and creating 
          art. My favorite mediums to work with include oil paint, acrylic paint, and color pencils.
          As an artist, I love finding the beauty in things around me, whether it’s elegant lines 
          of code or a peaceful mountain view. This is a space where I share the aspects of life 
          that inspire and captivate me.

        <h2 class="about-subtitle">why computer science?</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
          My interdisciplinary interests and love for solving puzzles naturally led me to 
          computer science. I’m drawn to the challenges found at the system level and fascinated 
          by how things work under the hood, from microwave timers and calculators to embedded 
          systems that power autonomous vehicles. As a visual thinker, I also enjoy exploring 
          web development and design. There’s something deeply satisfying about bringing an 
          idea to life through tools like Figma and translating it into smooth digital experiences.

         <h2 class="about-subtitle">my core: all forms of creativity</h2>
          <p class="about-text">Painting. Drawing. Jewelry-making. Beautiful note-taking. Ever since I could pick up a pencil
            (or paintbrush), I have had the insuppressible itch to create fine art. In recent years, my favorite 
            medium has  been color pencils of the Prismacolor brand, due to their smooth, buttery texture 
            and vibrant pigment overlays. To me, art is destressing, and keeps me in touch with the colorful,
            free-range part of my mind. Read more about how art helps in everyday life in my "art is life" blog 
            post! My favorite pieces will be up on this site soon-- stay tuned.

        <h2 class="about-subtitle">gym and books and stuff</h2>
        <p class="about-text">I love a routine. More importantly-- I need the gym in any routine. Read more about how I figured out
          a gym routine and my strategies for protein intake as a vegetarian in my "how to gym" blog post. I also
          read, when I get the chance to. Drama (especially tragedies) are my favorite because where's the 
          fun in constantly absorbing perfect storybook endings? Personally, I enjoy plots that reflect
          a beloved characters sorrow right off the pages, and into a readers' comprehension. Hence, my favorite
          author is Khaled Hosseini, author of masterpieces 'The Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'.
          Some more favorites include...
