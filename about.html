        <h2>so, why computer science?</h2>
          <p>My interdisciplinary interests and passion for solving 
            puzzles drove me towards this field. As an individual that 
            welcomes the challenges at the system-level
            of a computer, I am interested in embedded systems (what makes my 
            calculator work? what about the timer on my microwave? and autonomous 
            driving? the list goes on!). As an artist and visual thinker, I am equally
            fascinated by web development. Whether it be desiging a website with a focus 
            on elevating the user experience or contributing to intelligent, 
            energy-saving light automation systems, my ultimate objective is to 
            wield software engineering as a tool for improving the human condition.</p>

            <h2>my core: all forms of creativity</h2>
            <p>Painting. Drawing. Jewelry-making. Beautiful note-taking. Ever since I could pick up a pencil
              (or paintbrush), I have had the insuppressible itch to create fine art. In recent years, my favorite 
              medium has  been color pencils of the Prismacolor brand, due to their smooth, buttery texture 
              and vibrant pigment overlays. To me, art is destressing, and keeps me in touch with the colorful,
              free-range part of my mind. Read more about how art helps in everyday life in my "art is life" blog 
              post! My favorite pieces will be up on this site soon-- stay tuned.

            <h2>gym and books and stuff</h2>
            <p>I love a routine. More importantly-- I need the gym in any routine. Read more about how I figured out
              a gym routine and my strategies for protein intake as a vegetarian in my "how to gym" blog post. I also
              read, when I get the chance to. Drama (especially tragedies) are my favorite because where's the 
              fun in constantly absorbing perfect storybook endings? Personally, I enjoy plots that reflect
              a beloved characters sorrow right off the pages, and into a readers' comprehension. Hence, my favorite
              author is Khaled Hosseini, author of masterpieces 'The Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'.
              Some more favorites include...  
              <ul>- The Tattooist of Auschwitz by Heather Morris.</ul>
              <ul>- Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.</ul>
              <ul>- The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan.</ul>

I am an adamant and incurable foodie, and you will find me either reading a book, eating udon noodles, or working out in an attempt to make peace with the consequences of being a foodie, Aside from eating, playing badminton, watching movies, and playing boardgames, art is one of my oldest and dearest hobbies.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="caption"><u>My art story</u></h2>
        <p class = "ptwo"><img id = "pictwo" src = "images/PXL_20220624_145349407.PORTRAIT.jpg" alt = "">I have been painting, drawing, and creating ever since I discovered how to hold a paintbrush. I specialize in fine color pencil art, and treasure the life of all the prismacolors I have owned- from fresh, unused pencils to the stubs they eventually become. I am a relatively amateur oil painter, having completed my first oil painting in the year 2021. However, I am old friends with the smudgy warmth of oil pastels- particularly when it comes to still-life pieces. My most treasured skill was introduced to me later than other techniques.</p>
        <p id = "line"><em>On a visit to India in the year 2017, I learned the art of Henna.</em></p>
        <p class = "ptwo">At that age, although I attended classes over that trip, I still could not quite get the hang of it- learning to hold a henna cone proved especially tricky for my small, unaccustomed hands. More recently, I attempted Henna once again in the summer of 2021. This time, it clicked. The designs came to me naturally and before I knew it, my friends were requesting temporary tattoos of their own. This inspired me to start my first business, “Henna by Nia”, and the creation of this website as a means of communicating my passions. You can view my art under the “Portfolio” tab of this website and contact me at the following email for art commissions and henna appointments: <em>henna.by.nia31@gmail.com</em>. You can also view more of my henna posts on insta: <em>@henna.by.nia</em>. Nice to meet you!</p>
