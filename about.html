          Hi, I'm Nia! Thanks for visiting my website. Currently, I am
          a junior pursuing a major in computer science at the University
          of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK). Outside of school, I like to destress 
          by lifting weights or createing art pieces
          (mediums: color pencils, acrylic paints, oil paints). Check out some of
          my henna under the 'HENNA' tab! So far, I have lived on 3 different 
          continents and look forward to traveling and expanding that list. To read 
          more about interesting experiences or random thoughts I have had, head 
          over to my blog.
        </p>

      <div class="about-block">
        <h2 class="about-subtitle">so, why computer science?</h2>
        <p class="about-text">My interdisciplinary interests and passion for solving 
          puzzles drove me towards this field. As an individual that 
          welcomes the challenges at the system-level
          of a computer, I am interested in embedded systems (what makes my 
          calculator work? what about the timer on my microwave? and autonomous 
          driving? the list goes on!). As an artist and visual thinker, I am equally
          fascinated by web development. Whether it be desiging a website with a focus 
          on elevating the user experience or contributing to intelligent, 
          energy-saving light automation systems, my ultimate objective is to 
          wield software engineering as a tool for improving the human condition.

      <div class="about-block">
         <h2 class="about-subtitle">my core: all forms of creativity</h2>
          <p class="about-text">Painting. Drawing. Jewelry-making. Beautiful note-taking. Ever since I could pick up a pencil
            (or paintbrush), I have had the insuppressible itch to create fine art. In recent years, my favorite 
            medium has  been color pencils of the Prismacolor brand, due to their smooth, buttery texture 
            and vibrant pigment overlays. To me, art is destressing, and keeps me in touch with the colorful,
            free-range part of my mind. Read more about how art helps in everyday life in my "art is life" blog 
            post! My favorite pieces will be up on this site soon-- stay tuned.

      <div class="about-block">
        <h2 class="about-subtitle">gym and books and stuff</h2>
        <p class="about-text">I love a routine. More importantly-- I need the gym in any routine. Read more about how I figured out
          a gym routine and my strategies for protein intake as a vegetarian in my "how to gym" blog post. I also
          read, when I get the chance to. Drama (especially tragedies) are my favorite because where's the 
          fun in constantly absorbing perfect storybook endings? Personally, I enjoy plots that reflect
          a beloved characters sorrow right off the pages, and into a readers' comprehension. Hence, my favorite
          author is Khaled Hosseini, author of masterpieces 'The Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'.
          Some more favorites include...
